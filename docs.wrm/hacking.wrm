_heading: Dependencies

Adding a dependency is non-trivial and will require fairly convincing
arguments.

Further, **ALL** dependencies for ethers **must** be MIT licensed or
public domain (CC0).

All contributions to ethers are then included under the MIT license.


_heading: Printable ASCII (7-bit) Characters

All source and documentation files should ONLY use the printable ASCII
set.

This is for several reasons, bu... [TYPO!]

- Transmission over certain HTTP servers and proxies can mangle
  UTF-8 data
- Certain editors on some platforms, or in certain terminals cannot
  handle UTF-8 characters elegantly
- The ability to enter non-ASCII characters on some platforms require
  special keyboards, input devices or input methods to be installed,
  which either not be supported, or may require administrative
  priviledges.

_heading: Other Considerations

A common argument to Pull Requests is that they are simple, backwards compatible
and it is important to remember that a small change is something that
we are required to support in perpetuity.

For example, adding support for an obscure platform, such as adding a dot-file
to the root of the package, now carries the implication that we will continue
keeping that dot-file up-to-date as new versions of that platform are released.
