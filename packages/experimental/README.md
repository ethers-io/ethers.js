**BrainWallet**

In general, a Brain Wallet is not recommended, but it is a feature we offered in v3
and below. It allows a wallet to be described and recovered using a username and a
password. However, anyone who can guess a username and password can steal the funds,
and the password cannot be changed. But for backwards compatibility and for simple
testing, we provide it here.

```javascript
import { BrainWallet } from "@ethersproject/experimental/brain-wallet";

// This is optional, but since a Brain Wallet can take 5-10s to generate,
// helps keep your users informed
function showProgress(percent) {
    if (percent === 1) {
        console.log("Done.");
    } else {
        console.log("Completed: " + Math.trunc(100 * percent) + "%");
    }
}

// Generate a legacy-compatible Brain Wallet
BrainWallet.generateLegacy(username, password, showProgress).then((wallet) => {
    console.log(wallet);
});

// Generate a new-style Brain Wallet, which contains a Mnemonic Phrase too
BrainWallet.generate(username, password, showProgess).then((wallet) => {
    console.log(wallet);
});
```

**NonceManager**

```javascript
import { NonceManager } from "@ethersproject/experimental/nonce-manager";

let signer = "... any way you get a signer ...";

// The NonceManager Signer will automatically manage the nonce for you
// so you may blast the network with as many transactions as you would
// like. Transactions which have not been mined within XXX timeout and
// will be rebroadcast; keep in mind that unmined transactions remain
// in memory.
const managedSigner = new NonceManager(signer);
```

**Eip1193Bridge**

```javascript
import { Eip1193Bridge } from "@ethersproject/experimental/retry-provider";

const signer = "... any way you get an ethers Signer...";
const provider = "... any way you get an ethers Provider...";

const eip1193Provider = new Eip1193Bridge(signer, provider);

```
