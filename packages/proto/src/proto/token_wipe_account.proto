/**
 * Wipes the provided amount of tokens from the specified Account. Must be signed by the Token's
 * Wipe key.
 * If the provided account is not found, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID.
 * If the provided account has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to ACCOUNT_DELETED.
 * If the provided token is not found, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_ID.
 * If the provided token has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to TOKEN_WAS_DELETED.
 * If an Association between the provided token and account is not found, the transaction will
 * resolve to TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT.
 * If Wipe Key is not present in the Token, transaction results in TOKEN_HAS_NO_WIPE_KEY.
 * If the provided account is the Token's Treasury Account, transaction results in
 * CANNOT_WIPE_TOKEN_TREASURY_ACCOUNT
 * On success, tokens are removed from the account and the total supply of the token is decreased by
 * the wiped amount.
 * 
 * If both amount and serialNumbers get filled, a INVALID_TRANSACTION_BODY response code will be
 * returned.
 * If neither the amount nor the serialNumbers get filled, a INVALID_WIPING_AMOUNT response code
 * will be returned.
 * If the serialNumbers list contains a non-positive integer as a serial number, a INVALID_NFT_ID
 * response code will be returned.
 * If the serialNumbers' list count is greater than the batch size limit global dynamic property, a
 * BATCH_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED response code will be returned.
 * 
 * The amount provided is in the lowest denomination possible. Example:
 * Token A has 2 decimals. In order to wipe 100 tokens from account, one must provide amount of
 * 10000. In order to wipe 100.55 tokens, one must provide amount of 10055.
