/**
 * Applicable only to tokens of type NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE. Gets info on NFTs N through M on the list
 * of NFTs associated with a given NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE Token.
 * Example: If there are 10 NFTs issued, having start=0 and end=5 will query for the first 5 NFTs.
 * Querying +all 10 NFTs will require start=0 and end=10
 *
 * INVALID_QUERY_RANGE response code will be returned if:
 * 1) Start > End
 * 2) Start and End indices are non-positive
 * 3) Start and End indices are out of boundaries for the retrieved nft list
 * 4) The range between Start and End is bigger than the global dynamic property for maximum query
 * range
 *
 * NOT_SUPPORTED response code will be returned if the queried token is of type FUNGIBLE_COMMON
 *
 * INVALID_TOKEN_ID response code will be returned if the queried token does not exist
