/**
 * Mints tokens to the Token's treasury Account. If no Supply Key is defined, the transaction will
 * resolve to TOKEN_HAS_NO_SUPPLY_KEY.
 * The operation increases the Total Supply of the Token. The maximum total supply a token can have
 * is 2^63-1.
 * The amount provided must be in the lowest denomination possible. Example:
 * Token A has 2 decimals. In order to mint 100 tokens, one must provide amount of 10000. In order
 * to mint 100.55 tokens, one must provide amount of 10055.
 * If both amount and metadata list get filled, a INVALID_TRANSACTION_BODY response code will be
 * returned.
 * If the metadata list contains metadata which is too large, a METADATA_TOO_LONG response code will
 * be returned.
 * If neither the amount nor the metadata list get filled, a INVALID_TOKEN_MINT_AMOUNT response code
 * will be returned.
 * If the metadata list count is greater than the batch size limit global dynamic property, a
 * BATCH_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED response code will be returned.
